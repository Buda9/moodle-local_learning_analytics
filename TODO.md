# TO*DOs (spelled like this, so it doesn't show when searching for the word...)

- [x] **Add title to page**
- [x] **Make sure only people enrolled can see the statistics**
  - [x] use capabilities for this -> by default, students and teachers can view statistics
- [x] **Make `logstore_lanalytics` a dependency of this plugin**
- [x] **Give option to disable "Set course to compare" (as this makes no sense without data currently)**
- [x] Make "Activities" box link to activity report even if no recently used activiy exists
- [x] Report: Browser/mobile usage in course
  - [x] Integrate Moodle-API into desktop/mobile statistics
  - [x] Add language keys
- [x] **Add event `view_analytics` (or a similar event)**
- [x] Check localization
  - [x] **Add English text for all missing strings**
  - [x] **Add German texts for all missing strings**
- [x] Update README
- [x] Improve README
  - [x] Add info on installation
    - [x] Enable logstore
    - [x] Setup logstore (go over settings)
  - [x] Add info on settings of main plugin
    - [x] privacy threshold
    - [x] compare_options
- [x] Add information to tables: "Only data >= X is shown"
  - [ ] Mabye add this information on the dashboard (?)
- [x] Only show dashboard link in selected courses
- [x] Update README.md in reports folder
- [x] Don't show empty tables or empty data plots
- [x] Tracking roles whitelist (in addition to blacklist)
  - [x] Provide better options for which courses are logged:
    - [x] Option "Log"
      - [x] All courses
      - [x] Only the courses specified below (whitelist)
      - [x] Only the courses NOT specified  below (blacklist)
- [x] Local plugin:
  - [x] If logstore is disabled, don't show in the navigation
  - [x] Show analytics: (enables the Analytics page and add the link to the navigation)
    - [x] Show navigation link if logging is enabled for the course
    - [x] Show navigation link if course is specified below via course_ids
    - [x] Show navigation link even if logging is disabled for the course (only enable this, if you already logged data before)
    - [x] Hide navigation link but keep the page enabled (only if you know the link, you can access Analytics)
    - [x] Hide navigation link and also disable the page itself (even if logging happens in the background)
- [x] Make table with loggable courseids (instead of single setting)
  - After checking, I'll leave it like this for now as it's probably faster this way. The advantage will probably only come when there are a lot of courses added in this way...
- [x] Update README with new settings
- [x] Logstore plugin: Make sure it also works on its own (without this plugin)
  - [x] Make sure it only loads `lalog` plugins if this plugin is installed
- [x] Page that shows what kind of data is being tracked and whether one is being tracked => only anonymous data is being saved, not implemented
- [x] External database support => no feedback from ITC (not needed I guess..)

## Logstore
- [x] **Implement setting to only track specific courses** (as specified in `lanalytics/course_ids`)
- [x] **Don't track teachers for now**
- [x] Detect Moodle-API use

## GDPR
- [x] Create "Verfahrensverzeichnis"
- [x] Datenschutzerkl√§rung erstellen
- [x] Implement Moodle Privacy providers (new item further below)
- [x] Make sure that groups < X (aks GDPR officer) are not shown
  - [X] Ask (meeting 2020-03-10) what `X` is, configurable -> `10` by default
  - [X] Is is okay to still track the data (even when groups < `X`) but don't display results for smaller courses
    - [X] If necessary, change tracking algorithm to check size of course
  - [x] Change accordingly, examples:
    - [x] learners/courseparticipation list
    - [x] learners language/countries list

## Release
- [x] **Check coding guidelines** => Done, but we might to do this again...
- [x] Check hurdles for Moodle store
- [x] Decide the name: rwthanalytics? aixanalytics? => decide later

  - [ ] Constant date on dashboard page, with faked number of students, accesses, etc...
- [ ] Wording: "Learning Analytics Angebot" / "Modul" / "Service"

  - [ ] Give graph meaningful aria labels
  - [ ] Add aria-hidden to data that is not needed for screen readers

## Big course test
- [x] Generate a lot of data to test how the dashboard (especially the timecreated query) performs for big courses (> 1m events in a single course, power law regarding users)
- [ ] Also generate users

## For later...
- [ ] Users of our plugin still have the `lalog_browser_os` table installed (RWTH + HRW)
  - [ ] Plan: Get the data and then put uninstall routine into upgrade
- [ ] Describe subplugins in README
  - [ ] `lareport`
  - [ ] `lalog`

- [x] ~~"Consent-API"~~ Not until Moodle supports optional policies...
- [ ] Remove any magic numbers and strings and use constants file
- [ ] Put subplugin settings (like `allow_dashboard_compare`) in the actual subplugins (check if that really makes sense)
