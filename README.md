# Learning Analytics for Moodle

## Installation

First, download the dependency (`moodle-logstore_lanalytics`) and place the files in the `admin/tool/log/store/lanalytics` folder.

```
$ cd MOODLE_PATH
$ cd admin/tool/log/store
$ git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/laixmo/moodle-logstore_lanalytics.git lanalytics
```

After that repeat the steps for this plugin and place the files in the `local/learning_analytics` folder.

```
$ cd MOODLE_PATH
$ cd local
$ git clone https://git.rwth-aachen.de/laixmo/moodle-local_learning_analytics.git learning_analytics
```

The end result should look like this:

- `MOODLE_PATH/admin/tool/log/store/lanalytics` contains the contents of the `moodle-logstore_lanalytics` plugin
- `MOODLE_PATH/local/learning_analytics` contains the contents of the `local_learning_analytics` plugin

Now visit the Moodle administration page or the Moodle starting page and Moodle should detect the new plugins and install them. After installation, there should be a link in each course menu called "Learning Analytics" leading to the following page (`COURSE_ID` is the course id of the corresponding course):

```
https://MOODLE_INSTALLATION/local/learning_analytics/index.php/reports/coursedashboard?course=COURSE_ID
```

## Configuration

After installation you need to enable the logstore plugin. Optionally, you can configure both plugins.

1. Go to Moodle Site administration page
2. In the *Plugins* tab, scroll down to *Logging*
3. Click on *Manage log stores*
4. There should be a row for the installed `logstore` plugin with the name `Learning Analytics Log`
5. Click on the eye icon (`üëÅ`) to enable the log store.
